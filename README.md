## Who am I?
I am a research fellow at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) in Genoa, Italy. My background is in Bioengineering -- I obtained my B.Sc. in Bioengineering (Biomaterials) and Ph.D. in Bioengineering (Nanomedicine) from Clemson University (Clemson, SC, USA). In 2014, I moved to Fribourg, Switzerland and joined the BioNanomaterials group at the Adolphe Merkle Institute. After several years in Fribourg, I was awarded a Marie Skłodowska-Curie MINDED CO-FUND fellowship to study the transport of nanomedicines across the blood--brain barrier for the treatment of neurodevelopmental diseases. Since December 2018, I have been a fellow in the Nanotechnology for Precision Medicine group at IIT.

## What are these repositories?
My interest in programming comes from my older brother who is a software engineer. After seeing the kinds of things he was able to do in terms of automation, I was interested in learning how I could apply such tools towards my work in the lab. Furthermore, I received my first introduction into "programming" through my friend Dr. Wallace Campbell who introduced me to R as a language for data/statistical analysis and data visualization.

I am interested in building tools that help to automate or streamline data analysis and visualization in the "wet sciences." I am also learning (as an amateur) about machine learning tools and looking to apply those towards data analysis in the nanomedicine/bionanomaterials realm.

Most of these repositories are works in progress and simply a way for me to share ongoing projects.
